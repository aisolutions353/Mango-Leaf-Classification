# Mango-Leaf-Classification

In this project we developed an algorithm for the classification of the Mango Leaf.
There are two classes healthy and Diseasesed. To train the deep learning model we 
have collected a self generated dataset the model we have applied the SSD it performs
96% accuracte results. Here we created the architecture using the Tensorflow.

Setup of the the project:
1. Create a new environment with python 3.7
2. Install all the libraries using the following commands: ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
3. Run the Main.py file to run the code.
